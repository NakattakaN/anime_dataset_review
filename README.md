# How many reddit mentions does a anime have by its rating and popularity?
**DSA210 ‚Äì Introduction to Data Science**  
**Fall 2025 Term Project**

---

## Introduction  

This project explores what makes certain anime popular ‚Äî and how factors like genre, studio, source material, and season of release affect audience ratings and engagement.  

Using datasets from **MyAnimeList (MAL)** and **AniList**, along with external data like **Reddit mentions** and my own personal anilist data to understand a users general behaviours.

The goal is to find meaningful connections between an anime‚Äôs features and its success, as well as to see how online attention and release timing influence ratings. 

The latter transformator implementation will use ROBERTA and will try to guess the reddit rate considering MAL and ANILIST ratings.

## Motivation  

This projects motivation is to understand the correlation beetwen animes popularity and reddit mentions.

This project looks into questions like:  
- Do specific genres perform better in certain decades or seasons?  
- How do **studios** and **source materials** (manga, novel, game, original) impact ratings?  
- Is there a link between **online hype** (Reddit posts, Google searches) and **user ratings**?  
- Can we predict an anime‚Äôs success from its metadata alone?  

By analyzing these aspects, we can better understand audience behavior and cultural trends within anime communities.

## Project Goals  

- Analyze **anime trends** over time by decade, genre, and studio.  
- Identify which factors most affect **ratings and popularity**.  
- Explore **seasonal release trends** (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).  
- Compare **online attention** (Reddit & Google Trends) with viewer scores.  
- Build simple **predictive models** for anime popularity.  
- Visualize data to show changes in the anime industry over time.

## Methodology  

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Merge multiple sources (MAL, AniList, Reddit, Google Trends).  
- Remove duplicates, standardized names, and fixed missing data.  
- Encode categorical variables (genres, studios, sources).  
- Converte airing dates into `year` and `season`.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Summary stats for ratings, members, favorites, and episode counts.  
- Visualize genre distributions and correlations.  
- Examine release trends across seasons and decades.  

### 3. Statistical Analysis  
- Correlation and regression analysis for rating vs. features.  
- ANOVA tests for genre or studio differences.  
- Seasonal trend analysis for release and popularity data.  

### 4. Machine Learning Models (optional)  
- Regression models (Linear, Random Forest) to predict popularity score.  
- Classification (e.g., ‚ÄúHit‚Äù vs ‚ÄúNon-Hit‚Äù anime).  
- Feature importance visualization.
